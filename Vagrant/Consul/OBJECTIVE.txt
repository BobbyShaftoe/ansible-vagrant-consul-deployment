  ### OBJECTIVE ###

  Both a high-level comparison AND a measured analysis of the functionality, reliability, repeatability, robustness
  of different methods of container deployments and how service discovery and routing can be implemented.
  This will include performance metrics. (deployment time, response time/service availability, etc)

  - Overview of deployemnt -
  Using a CI/CD tool (eg. Jenkins) to automate infrastructure deployment,
  and a configuration management tool (eg. Ansible), containers will be built and deployed,
  as a microservice architecture. Typical 3 tier application stack.

  - Methods of Container Orchestration to compare -

      * Rancher
      * Nomad
      * Kubernetes
      * EC2
